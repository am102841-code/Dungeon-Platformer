Dungeon Platformer 
------------------
A 2-d platformer that is dungeon themed with newly added dungeon music tracks that vary from levels 1-5. This project was inspired by games Terraria and Ro and developed for over two years with countless updates.

Go to my published game webpage and play the game: https://platformer-webpage--am102841.replit.app/

In the future, I am going to add a shop, multiple player skins, sprite sheet animations for the player and coins, and even multiplayer. 

I also have an **MIT License**; feel free to check that out.
